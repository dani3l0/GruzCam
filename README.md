# Abandoned

right after start

Raspberry Pi seems to be exceptionally trashy shit at OBS Studio, instead of 1080p60 stream RPi was able to handle 720p with 0.5fps

**_So, what's needed?_**

- iGPU hardware encoder/decoder (which RPi 3a lacks)
- more ram (while 512mb is enough, would be cool to have 1gb to run things smoothly)

_goodbye_
